## Project Structure

## Summary of Changes and Fixes

### Database and Login Issues

During development, we encountered several issues related to database connectivity and user login functionality. This section summarizes the problems we faced and the solutions implemented to resolve them.

#### Database Connection Issues

1.  **Missing Database URI:** Initially, the application failed to connect to the database due to the absence of the `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` configuration.
    *   **Fix:** We modified `backend/app/__init__.py` to load configuration settings from `backend/app/config.py` before initializing the database. We added `app.config.from_object(Config)` in `create_app()`.
    *   **Fix:** We ensured that `db.init_app(app)` was called after the configuration was loaded.
2. **Config File**: The Config file was missing fallback values for `SECRET_KEY` and `JWT_SECRET_KEY`.
     *   **Fix:** We modified `backend/app/config.py` and added a fallback for both variables.
3. **Run.py**: The Run.py file was not loading the configuration file.
    * **Fix:** We changed the `run.py` file and added a temporary Flask app instance to load the config file.

#### Login Issues

1.  **JWT Secret Key Not Set:** The application threw an error indicating that the `JWT_SECRET_KEY` was not set, preventing the creation of JWT tokens.
    *   **Fix:** We added a default value of `'super-secret'` for the `JWT_SECRET_KEY` in `backend/app/config.py`. However, it is very important to set a secure value in a productive environment.
2.  **Transaction Error:** The login process would fail with an `sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError`, indicating an attempt to begin a transaction when one was already active.
    *   **Fix:** We removed the redundant `db.session.begin()` call in `backend/app/routes.py` within the login function, allowing the transaction to be managed correctly.

### Additional Changes

1. **Blueprints:** We changed the `backend/app/__init__.py` to include the `main_bp` Blueprint.
2. **CORS:** We configured the CORS Settings so localhost and the main domain are accessible.


### Production Database Configuration

For production deployments, it is crucial to configure the database connection securely and correctly:

1.  **Environment Variables:** Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable with your database connection string (e.g., `mysql://user:password@host/database`) in the `.env.local` or on the server.
2.  **Secure Credentials:** Ensure that the database username and password used in the connection string are strong and unique to this application.
3.  **Database User Permissions:** Limit the permissions of the database user to only what is necessary for the application to function (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`).
4.  **SSL/TLS:** Configure your database to use SSL/TLS encryption to secure the connection between the application and the database server.


The project follows a monorepo structure containing separate frontend and backend applications:

-   `frontend/`: Contains the Vue.js single-page application.
-   `backend/`: Contains the Python Flask REST API.

## Frontend (`frontend/`)

-   **Framework:** Vue.js (`v3.5.13`)
-   **Build Tool:** Vite (`v6.2.3`)
-   **Routing:** Vue Router (`v4.5.0`)
-   **HTTP Client:** Axios (`v1.8.4`) for communicating with the backend API.
-   **Styling:** Bootstrap (`v5.3.3`)
-   **State/Event Management:** `mitt` (`v3.0.1`) is included, likely for cross-component communication.
-   **Key Directories:** `src/` (main source), `src/components/`, `src/views/`, `src/router/`, `src/services/`.

## Backend (`backend/`)

-   **Framework:** Python Flask (`v3.1.0`)
-   **Database ORM:** SQLAlchemy (`v2.0.40`)
-   **Database Migrations:** Alembic (`v1.15.1`) via Flask-Migrate (`v4.1.0`)
-   **Database Driver:** PyMySQL (suggesting a MySQL database)
-   **Authentication:** JWT-based using Flask-JWT-Extended (`v4.7.1`). Passwords hashed securely using Argon2 (`argon2-cffi v23.1.0`).
-   **API & Security:**
    -   Flask-Cors (`v5.0.1`) for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
    -   Flask-Limiter (`v3.5.0`) for API rate limiting.
-   **Deployment:** Gunicorn included, indicating suitability for production deployment.
-   **Key Files/Directories:** `run.py` (entry point), `app/routes.py`, `app/models.py`, `app/config.py`, `migrations/`.

## Root Directory (`./`)

-   **Node.js Configuration:** Contains `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.
    -   **Note:** The root `package.json` includes `start` and `dev` scripts pointing to a non-existent `backend/server.js`. This might be outdated configuration from a previous project structure, as the backend is clearly Python/Flask based on `backend/requirements.txt` and `backend/run.py`.
-   **Security:**
    -   `SECURITY_REFACTOR_PLAN.md`: Indicates documented plans for security improvements.
    -   `npm_audit.json`: Suggests Node.js dependency vulnerabilities have been audited (likely relevant to the frontend).

## Overall

The project is a web application with a Vue.js frontend interacting with a Python Flask backend API, using a MySQL database. It incorporates standard practices for authentication, database management, and API security. Attention should be paid to the potentially conflicting configuration in the root `package.json`.
